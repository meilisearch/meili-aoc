                --- SOS GPS --- <br><br>

                Hey fellow, <br><br>

                <i>Santa needs your help once again to save this festive moment</i><br><br>

                Since there are so many children every year, Santa needed a machine that creates a structure that regroups all the children's addresses with as few instructions as possible.<br><br>

                Santa has invested a lot in a machine called the <em>Gift-o-tron-3000</em> to facilitate his gift-giving tour.<br><br>

                Unfortunately, the last update for the <em>**Gift Positioning System** (GPS)</em> feature has deteriorated its functioning.<br><br>

                As the CTO of Santa Inc, you are the best elf to help Santa on this critical issue since everyone else is already on vacation!<br><br>

                Your input look like that:<br><br>
                <pre><code>tamo - RLRLR
loic - <em>RLLL</em>
kero - LRLR
luna - LRRR
lena - RLLR
thomas - LRLL
tommy - LLL
chayaline - LRLL</code></pre>

                <br>

                On the left is the name of the child that needs to get his gift.<br>
                On the right is the path to go to his house. Each <em>L</em> means Santa needs to turn <em>left</em>, and each <em>R</em> means he needs to turn <em>right</em>. <br><br>

                For example, for Santa to go to luna's house, he needs to turn <em>left</em>, <em>right</em>, <em>right</em>, and <em>right</em>.<br><br>

                With the input above, this is what the structure would look like:<br><br>

                <pre><code>
       LL - - - - - - tommy
       /   L - - - - - chayaline, thomas
      /   /
     /   L - R - - - - kero
    /   /
   L - R - RR - - - -  luna
  /
 /      L - - - - - -  loic
o      /
 \    L - R - - - - -  lena
  \  /
   RL - RLR - - - - -  tamo</code></pre>

                <br>

                The <em>Gift-o-tron-3000</em> has now a lot of issues, sometimes it takes days to answer, and sometimes it outputs wrong results. Thus you have the brilliant idea of building a new machine that ensures the result is correct.<br><br>

                In order to work, it needs to get all the paths sorted. The <em>left</em> turns first, and then the <em>right</em> turns. <br><br>

                Your goal is to find which child Santa can access with as few instructions as possible. <br><br>

                In this case, <em>tommy</em> and <em>tamo</em> are the only two children accessible in only two instructions. But since <em>tommy</em> will appear first in the structure, he's going to get his gift first. <br><br>

                <div id="puzzle-input-1" class="puzzle-input">
                    To begin, <a class="link" href="#">get your puzzle input</a>.
                </div>

                <div id="error-1" class="error"></div>
                <div id="input-group-1">
                    <input id="answer-1" class="answer" type="text" placeholder="Answer" />
                    <input id="submit-1" class="submit" type="submit" value="[SUBMIT]" />
                </div>

                <p id="success-msg-part-1">BRAVO!</p>
            </div>

            <div id="part-2">

                --- Part2 --- <br><br>

                For the second part, you have a brilliant improvement in mind. You need to count how many instructions it'll take to Santa go from the closest to the closest child (still in a number of instructions). <br><br>

                        Step 1: tommy was the closest, 2 instructions away.

                                LL - - - - - - 2 instructions
                                /   L - - - - - chayaline, thomas

                        Step 2: luna was the closest, 3 instructions away.

                                    L - - - - - chayaline, thomas

                            RL - RLR - - - - -  tamo

                        Step 3: chayaline and thomas were the closest, 3 instructions away.

                                    L - - - - - 8 instructions

                        Step 4: kero was the closest, 2 instructions away.

                                L - R - - - - 10 instructions

                        Step 5: tamo was the closest, 6 instructions away.

                                L - - - - - -  loic

                            RL - RLR - - - - -  16 instructions

                        Step 6: loic was the closest, 3 instructions away.

                                L - - - - - -  19 instructions

                        Step 7: lena was the closest, 2 instructions away.
